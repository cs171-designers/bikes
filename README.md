The README file must give an overview of what you are handing in: which parts are your code, which parts are libraries, and so on. The README must contain URLs to your project websites and screencast videos. The README must also explain any non-obvious features of your interface.

# Our code is contained in the "bikes" directory, organized by Javascript (js), CSS (css), and our html file (index.html). 

# The URL to our screencast video is https://youtu.be/UwumBb4fs5g 


# The URL to our website is https://cs171-designers.github.io/bikes/

We added some little Easter eggs for the intrepid user. Besides the two clickable interactive buttons which as the user to take a guess at the data insights (for example, Quad/Mather), we also have an image which displays when you hover over the text "However, there is a nonzero amount of nighttime riders out there enjoying the empty streets."

"Can you guess in what season most rides occcur?" brings you to the next section of our visualization, which is a dashboard. Clicking this button also makes blue text display which is the answer.
