						Bluebikes, <b>Boston's bikesharing program</b>, was launched in 2011. Ten years later, there are now over <b>3,800 bikes deployed in ten municipalities.</b>

						In our exploratory analysis, we shed light on how users interact with Bluebikes in one representative <b>pre-pandemic</b> year.
					</p>
					<p>

						As you take a ride through our data story, try to understand how ridership varies across <b>demographics</b>, and how the <b>greater Harvard community <i>really</i></b> interacts with the bikes that are so ubiquitous around campus.

						based on total traffic or solely on departures from or arrivals to each station. The
						difference between arrivals and departures can show us which stations are net positive, net
						negative, and net zero bikes.

						From this map, we can see that most stations have roughly the same number of departures and
						arrivals. The Bluebikes station in Central Square was the most popular station by far,
						which makes sense given that it is conveniently located between Harvard's and MIT's campuses.
						<br>
						<br>
						When making this dashboard we were interested to see if we could tell whether
						Quad students or Mather/Dunster students made more Bluebikes trips. Looking at the Garden St
						station
						near the Quad and the DeWolfe St station near Mather/Dunster, Quad students and Mather/Dunster
						students took roughly the same number of trips.

						From these pie charts, we see that most Bluebikes users are Males, then Females. Users with
						unspecified
						gender are likely customers who were not registered members, so their demographic information is
						unavailable.
					</p>
					<p>
						We might notice that there is more male rides than female rides. However, it is important to
						note that these are the number of rides and not the number of users (because users are
						anonymized). This invites questions of whether this is due to a difference in the number of
						users by sex or the number of average rides per user by sex.
					</p>
					<p>
						Looking at the age chart, there are a couple insights. First we see that the number of rides for
						ages 28-38 is close to or greater than the number of rides for ages 18-28. This is interesting
						because we are looking at rides centered around the Harvard campus.
					</p>
					<p>
						We can infer that there is probably a low percentage of undergraduate users. These stations are
						centered around Harvard which combined have an undergraduate population of almost 10
						thousand. If we divide the number of rides by 10k, and consider the time frame we see that the
						number of rides is quite low.

					<h5>Conclusions</h5>
					<p>
						from this data, we see that the most Bluebikes rides on Harvard’s campus are completed by
						subscribers,
						males, and adults 25+. Subscribers take on average 15 minute shorter rides. Females take
						slightly
						longer rides than males. Youth have a lot of variation in trip duration, though young adults and
						adults tend to take trips that are about 15 minutes long.
