				<h5>Intro on our motivations</h5>
				<p>
					Both interest and need for sustainable and usable public transportation systems are growing.
					Transportation is a key part of student life, as well as city and campus planning. Walk times,
					shuttles, buses, trains, and bikes are all transportation systems that impact the day-to-day life of
					students, residents, and college administrators.
				</p>

				<p>
					We chose to explore biking, since the city bike organization for Boston, Bluebikes, publishes its
					data and encourages analysis of the data and creation of data visualizations. We chose Bluebikes
					specifically, because the data and analysis is relevant to us students; in fact, two of the members
					of this team actively use Bluebikes. Cambridge is a particularly bike-friendly city in terms of
					terrain and climate, which should yield interesting data that can inform the implementation of bike
					sharing programs in other cities.
				</p>
				<p>
					In our analysis of BLUEbike usage, we have focused on identifying trends in usage on Harvard campus
					specifically. We are interested in exploring where on campus, including both the undergraduate and graduate
					schools, are most frequently visited using BlueBikes and what the typical user profile is like.
					We also analyze only 2018-2019 data, which includes more detailed demographic information along with
					the rides data.

				<h5>Let's follow a bike! Understanding BLUEbikes</h5>
				<p>
					Welcome to Boston!
					Here is a map that follows a bike around the city. We will go on a virtual ride
					so that even if you have never borrowed a Bluebike, you can understand the process of how
					a bike may be checked out from one station, ridden for a certain amount of time,
					and then returned to another station;
					then another user may borrow the bike from that station,
					and the cycle continues.

					BlueBike users may be subscription members or customers who pay for each trip.

						From these pie charts, we see that most BLUEbike users are Males, then Females. Users with
						unspecified
						gender are likely customers who were not registered members, so their demographic information is
						unavailable.
					</p>
					<p>
						We might notice that there is more male rides than female rides. However, it is important to
						note that these are the number of rides and not the number of users (because users are
						anonymized). This invites questions of whether this is due to a difference in the number of
						users by sex or the number of average rides per user by sex.
					</p>
					<p>
						Looking at the age chart, there are a couple insights. First we see that the number of rides for
						ages 28-38 is close to or greater than the number of rides for ages 18-28. This is interesting
						because we are looking at rides centered around the Harvard campus.
					</p>
					<p>
						We can infer that there is probably a low percentage of undergraduate users. These stations are
						centered around Harvard which combined have an undergraduate population of almost 10
						thousand. If we divide the number of rides by 10k, and consider the time frame we see that the
						number of rides is quite low.

					<h5>Trip Duration trends</h5>

						Although we know that Males, Subscribers, and Adults (mostly 18-38) constitute a majority of the rides,
						how does the average trip duration of each ride compare across demographic categories?
					</p>

					<p> [[INSERT FORM]] Do you expect subscribers or non-sbuscribers to take longer trips on average?</p>

					<p>
						Although subscribers take more rides than non-subscribers, these rides are actually shorter
						(by about 15 minutes) on average than rides by non-subscribing customers! This could be because
						subscribers are already paying for unlimited rides and feel that it is worth the money to
						indulge in shorter rides.

						Following the same trend, users with unknown gender are likely non-subscribing customers where
						their demographic data is not entered. So, they also tend to take longer rides along the same
						trend as the customers line in the previous graph. However, we also see that Male and Female
						riders tend to take trips that are about the same duration, although trips by Females are slightly longer.

						males, and adults 25+. Subscribers take on average 15 minute shorter rides. Females take slightly
						longer rides than males. Youth have a lot of variation in trip duration, though young adults and
