						Bluebikes, <b>Boston's bikesharing program</b>, was launched in 2011. Ten years later, there are now over <b>3,800 bikes deployed in ten municipalities.</b>

						In our exploratory analysis, we shed light on how users interact with Bluebikes in one representative <b>pre-pandemic</b> year.

					<p>

						We
						present
						2018-2019 data centered on Harvard, which is representative of a city environment and college campus,

						As you take a ride through our data story, try to understand how ridership varies across <b>demographics</b>, and how the <b>greater Harvard community <i>really</i></b> interacts with the bikes that are so ubiquitous around campus.

<!--						Here is a study were we can explore data around Bluebikes rides and demographics. <b>We have-->

						From these pie charts, we see that most Bluebikes users are Males, then Females. Users with

					</p>
					<p>
						We might notice that there are more male rides than female rides. However, it is important to
						note that this pie chart refers to the number of rides and not the number of users (because users are
						anonymized). As in the dashboard, this invites questions of whether this is due to a difference in the number of
						users by sex or the number of average rides per user by sex.
					</p>
					<p>
						Looking at the age chart, there are a couple of insights. First, we see that the number of rides for
						ages 28-38 is close to or greater than the number of rides for ages 18-28. This is interesting
						because we are looking at rides centered around the Harvard campus.
					</p>
					<p>
						We can infer that there is probably a low percentage of undergraduate users. These stations are
						centered around Harvard which combined have an undergraduate population of almost ten
						thousand. If we divide the number of rides by 10,000, and consider the total time frame, we see that the
						number of rides is quite low.

					<h5>Conclusions</h5>
					<p>

						PIE CHART INSIGHTS

						for 48-58, more customers than subscribers
						from this data, we see that the most Bluebikes rides on Harvard’s campus are completed by
						subscribers,
						males, and adults 25+. Subscribers take on average 15 minute shorter rides. Females take
						slightly
						longer rides than males. Youth have diverse uses of Bluebikes, with a lot of variation in trip duration, though young adults and
						adults tend to take trips that are about 15 minutes long.
					</p>

					<p>
						Both interest and need for sustainable and usable public transportation systems are growing.
						Transportation is a key part of student life, as well as city and campus planning.

						Walk times,
						shuttles, buses, trains, and bikes are all transportation systems that impact the day-to-day
						life of
						students, residents, and college administrators.
					</p>
					<p> It is not our intention to give feel-good advice about bicycle exercise or present an advertisement for Bluebikes.

						We simply want to provide you with information to understand the services that are supposed to be serving you and your community.
						Information about usage across demographics, temporal and seasonal ebbs and flows which may inform the transportation habits of yourself and those around you.
					</p>
					<p>

						To evaluate what they are and how they are being used. To whether they are suiting your needs, and the neighborhoods and campus in which you study and work and live. And to provide you with the resources to actively understand and interrogate the structures around you so that you can make informed choices about what you use or don't use, how Bluebikes might or might not fit into your life and what you might do about it. Whether that is:

					<ul> going out to buy a Bluebikes membership of your own </ul>
						<ul> getting a subsidized one through Harvard </ul>
							<ul> using more public transportation </ul>
								<ul> buying a bike </ul>
									<ul> or simply engaging with the urban environment around you. </ul>

						At a more granular level, as students who all live in the Radcliffe Quadrangle and regularly commute to Allston (for CS171), we are particularly interested in how Harvard is making the SEC more accessible. Harvard has placed non-SEAS courses, and core courses, in the SEC as an attempt to “destigmatize” this section of campus. ​​Engineering a Unified Campus and SEAS Students Adjust to Allston Commute are news articles from this semester that detail rising concerns about transportation methods.
